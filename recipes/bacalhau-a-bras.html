    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Original from Portugal, the 
    seafood capital of the world, this dish combines ingredients,  
    conceptually far apart, into an unexpected harmony to the palate.
    Bacalhau à Brás is a mix of what Portugal has best to offer. 
    This dish consists of cod fish submersed in an egg and fried 
    shoestring potato mixture, cooked in onion, garlic and olive
    oil, and garnished with black pepper, parsley and olives.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>450g of cod fish</li>
        <li>1L of cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>12 olives</li>
        <li>4 potatoes</li>
        <li>1 branch of parsley</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them in thin shoestring
            potatoes. Rest them in water for 30 min, to remove
            the excess of starch.
        </li>
        <li>Boil the cod fish for 10 minutes with a pinch of salt.
            Then, remove the skin and the bones and shred it with
            your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Strain the potatoes and dry them well with a cloth
            or paper towel. Fry them in the pre-heated cooking
            oil.
        </li>
        <li>In the meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a frying pan
            and cook the peeled and cut in half-moon onion, together
            with the peeled and finely diced garlic.
        </li>
        <li>When the onion and garlic start to soften, add the 
            shredded cod fish and close the pan with the lid.
        </li>
        <li>Cook in medium heat until the cod starts getting solid
            white with very little browning.
        </li>
        <li>Add the fried shoestring potatoes</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, previously whisked with a pinch of black 
            pepper, and mix them softly allowing them to involve 
            every ingredient. Don't let them cook and dry too much.
        </li>
        <li>Before serving, sprinkle the cut parsley and decorate 
            with the olives.
        </li>
    </ol>
