    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Carbonara is the simplest yet
        one of the most delicious dishes Italy as brought to life.
        This icon of the italian cousine consists on a pasta base 
        (usually, spaghetti or penne), a creamy sauce made with
        egg yolks, parmiggiano cheese and pecorino cheese, decorated
        with crispy dices of guanciale.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>400g of spaghetti or large diameter penne</li>
        <li>200g of guanciale</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>70g parmiggiano reggiano</li>
        <li>40g pecorino romano</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and 
            bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and 
            return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring 
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
            about 12 minutes. Reserve a little pasta water, then 
            drain.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium heat; add 
            diced guanciale, cook and stir until crisp, 5 to 10 
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl together with the grated
            cheeses and ground black pepper to taste. Add pasta 
            water until mixture is creamy.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the crispy guanciale, add the pasta and 
            the egg and cheese cream, and toss until evenly coated.
        </li>
    </ol>
