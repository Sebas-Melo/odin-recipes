# odin-recipes

This is my first project on the TOP curriculum and consists on a simple website, based solely on html, to provide the recipes of three of my favorite dishes: Bacalhau à Brás, Carbonara, and Picanha.

In this project I had to make use of a variety of learnings obtained on the first stages of the TOP curriculum, on html topics such as headings, lists, links, images, and text. Additionally, I made use, for the first official time, of Git and Github in this project.

Hope you enjoy the recipes!
